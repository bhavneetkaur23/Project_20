POPULARITY ON SPOTIFY

Project Description:
This project aims to conduct a thorough data analysis and classification task. 
Starting with dataset acquisition, we focus on understanding and cleaning the data. 
Exploring the concept of popularity within the dataset, we select a subset for analysis and choose relevant features. 
Preprocessing and preparing the features, we split the data for training and testing. We then apply various classification techniques, including ordinal logistic regression, KNN, and a multiclass Random Forest model. 
The project focuses on gaining insights, refining features, selecting appropriate models, and optimizing their performance.
